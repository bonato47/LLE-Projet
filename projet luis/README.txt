################## Quick remarks before running the notebook ####################
 _______________________________________________________________________________
|Our code for the project is separated in a functions.py			|
|containing the functions used in the main notebook Advanced_ML.ipynb.		|
|The dataset is around 150MB and some cells in the notebook might take a while 	|
|to see the results (hours in some cases). However, the results can be seen	|
|already in the notebook without running.					|
|Finally, in the notebook there will be some explanations about the parts of	|
|the code for a better understanding of what is being done and how to run 	|
|custom tests.									|
